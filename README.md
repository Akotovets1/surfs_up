## Overview of the analysis
The goal of this analysis is to create a basic statistical analysis of the temperatures on Oahu during the June and December.
By creating a query that captures the temperatures specifically for the June and December, we can get information such as average, maximum, and minimum temperatures.

## Results

June temperature statistics:

December temperature statistics:

### Comparing the temperatures for the two months, we can see the following:

1. There were 12% more temperature points for June than there were for December.
2. The mean temperature for December was 71 degrees, which is nearly four degrees cooler than June's mean temperature of 74.9 degrees.
3. The maximum temperature for June was 85 degrees, which is two degrees warmer than December's maximum temperature of 83 degrees

## Summary

Comparing the June and December weather patterns, the temperatures means are reasonably close, therefore, we can conclude that the data support opening a Surf and Ice Cream shop year-round.

Also we could make two additional quiries:
- June precipitation statistics
- December precipitation statistics

This would help to make our analysis more accurate as precipitation data can also affect business performance.
